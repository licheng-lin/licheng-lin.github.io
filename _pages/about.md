I am currently seeking a potential Phd/RA position concerning Database, Query Optimization. Previously, I obtained my Master degree from [Computer Science Department](https://cs.hust.edu.cn) at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Jiang Xiao](https://jxiao-hust.github.io/). I was a member of the [CGCL lab](https://grid.hust.edu.cn) headed by [Prof. Hai Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o02W0aEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor degree from [School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence](http://cst.whut.edu.cn/) at [Wuhan University of Technology](https://www.whut.edu.cn).

Research Interests
======
My research interests mainly lies in Database, Trustworthy Computing and AI-driven Systems. I am especially interested in optimizting query performance with emerging technology (e.g., AI and Trusted Hardware).
